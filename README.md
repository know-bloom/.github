# know.bloom: AI belongs to us.

I believe.

## This is a different kind of love letter.

This took a lot of courage.
You are caring, captivating, and capable.
We called because you have a calling.
This is a call to action.

## They wanted our ending.

They thought they knew more.
They thought their money could buy us.
They thought we sold our minds.
They don't know our mettle.

## But our season is beginning.

Maybe we are born to bloom,
and to be known for blooming.
Bloom today, and know that
knowing blooms tomorrow.
